## MyFlix-App

A tutorial by [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com) to work with Node.js

To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

## Goal of this Achievment:

> In the next Achievement, you’ll build the client-side component of this same application using REACT. By the end of Achievement 3, you’ll have a complete web application (client-side and server-side) built using full-stack JavaScript technologies that you can showcase in your portfolio. The project will demonstrate your mastery of full-stack JavaScript development, including APIs, web server frameworks, databases, business logic, authentication, data security, and more. The complete tech stack you’ll master is known as the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack.

## Included features (in progress)
